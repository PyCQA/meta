All projects in the PyCQA should have a Code of Conduct that they are willing
to enforce.


Project Management
==================

Each project is managed by its own members. There is no over-arching
management over all projects in the PyCQA. While many people *could* merge
pull requests and close issues on *all* repositories, they are trusted to not
do so unless they are specifically a member of the team maintaining that
project. At least one member of each project's administration will be an Owner
of the organzation. This is to allow them to manage their teams and membership
of others in teams.


Team Structure
==============

Projects are encouraged to have as many teams as they deem necessary to run
their project. Most projects operate with the following:

- Team of administrators - this team has "Admin" permissions in GitHub for
  the project's repository/repositories.

- Team of developers (or cores, or whatever you want to call them) - this team
  has "Write" permissions in GitHub for the project's repository/repositories.

This set-up allows projects to add more people who can merge pull requests and
close issues without being able to change settings on the repository itself,
add or remove services, etc.
