 Join the Community!
=====================

There are quite a few ways to get involved with the PyCQA.

#. You can contribute directly to projects in a variety of ways

#. You can start discussions by opening issues on our meta_ repository

#. You can join us on Discord_ where every project will receive space of their
   own for conversations and collaborations.

#. You can chat with a few of us on IRC on the Libera.chat_ server in the
   ``##python-code-quality`` channel (See also ":ref:`using-irc`")

#. You can join our `mailing list`_ (this list does not receive a large amount
   of messages so it should not cause an information overload if you join)

Using IRC
=========

.. note::

   Our primary method of synchronous communication is Discord_. IRC is still
   used by some members but is not the primary location and is not thoroughly
   monitored.

IRC_ is an old and durable protocol that allows people to chat in real time.
There are many ways to begin using IRC but we recommend using Libera's
webchat_ as it is both secure (served over TLS) and should work in any
browser. IRCHelp.org has a great tutorial_ to learn how to use IRC.

If you outgrow Libera's webchat, there are a number of other options for
connecting to IRC. Wikipedia has an overwhelmingly long `list of IRC
clients`_.

The following is a list of clients that the current members of the PyCQA use:

Windows
-------

- Hexchat_ (Graphical, Also works on macOS and Linux)

macOS

- Textual_ (Graphical, WebKit based)

- weechat_ (Curses, Terminal program)
