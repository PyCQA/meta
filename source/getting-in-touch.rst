=====================
 Join the Community!
=====================

There are quite a few ways to get involved with the PyCQA.

Asynchronous Methods
====================

GitHub
------

You can contribute directly to projects in a variety of ways.

Each project should have documentation for how to participate. Please visit
the specific project's documentation and repository for instructions.

Mailing List
------------

You can join our `mailing list`_ (this list does not receive a large amount
of messages so it should not cause an information overload if you join).

If you have questions about a project or its maintenance and the project seems
inactive on GitHub, please use the mailing list to inquire. Please also check
the archives for prior discussions before posting new threads.

.. note::

   The mailing list is partially moderated. This means that if you join the
   list, your first message may be held until an administrator reviews it and
   allows your posts to automatically be posted.

   A fair amount of spam is sent to the mailing list, and this moderation
   protects your inbox at the expense of moderators and administrators. If
   you'd like to help with moderating the list, reach out to the admin address
   listed on the mailing list page.

Meta Issue Tracker
------------------

You can start discussions by opening issues on our meta_ repository. If
there's some governance question that for some reason seems unsuitable to the
Mailing List, feel free to open an issue on the meta_ repository.

Semi-Synchronous Methods
========================

Discord
-------

You can join us on Discord_ where every project will receive space of their
own for conversations and collaborations.

We are aware that Discord requires non-free software, but the benefits to the
user and the organization far outweigh that one ideological barrier.

IRC
---

.. note::

   Our primary method of semi-synchronous communication is Discord_. IRC is still
   used by some members but is not the primary location and is not thoroughly
   monitored. **Your queries may go unanswered here.**

You can chat with a few of us on IRC on the Libera.chat_ server in the
``##python-code-quality`` channel (See also ":ref:`using-irc`")

IRC_ is an old and durable protocol that allows people to chat in real time.
There are many ways to begin using IRC but we recommend using Libera's
webchat_ as it is both secure (served over TLS) and should work in any
browser. IRCHelp.org has a great tutorial_ to learn how to use IRC.

If you outgrow Libera's webchat, there are a number of other options for
connecting to IRC. Wikipedia has an overwhelmingly long `list of IRC
clients`_.

The following is a list of clients that the current members of the PyCQA use:

Windows
+++++++

- Hexchat_ (Graphical, Also works on macOS and Linux)

macOS
+++++

- Textual_ (Graphical, WebKit based)

- weechat_ (Curses, Terminal program)

Linux
+++++

- weechat_ (Curses, Terminal program)

- irssi_ (Curses, Terminal program)
